This program emulates a cash register at a grocery store. A .txt file is read to an array of object instances each containing
product code, item name, and unit price. We then prompt the user for input (y/n),  which determines if a sale is to be 
conducted. The process of the sale involves prompting the user for more input, and calling on various methods to process that
input. When the user has finished their purchase they will enter (-1) as a product code, which will then call on various
methods to generate a receipt in ascending order by item name. The program will then prompt the user with the decision to 
begin another sale. If true, repeat instructions above; if false, the program prints the total sale for the day, and thanks 
the user for using the system.
